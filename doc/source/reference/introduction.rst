Quirrel is a high-level, imperative-OO programming language, designed to be a powerful
scripting tool that fits within the size, memory bandwidth, and real-time requirements of
applications like games.

It is based on Squirrel Script language (http://www.squirrel-lang.org/), but modified to be safer, stricter and faster.
Quirrel is not backward compatible with original Squirrel (see :ref:`Diff from original <diff_from_original>`)

Quirrel offers a wide range of features like dynamic typing, delegation, higher
order functions, generators, tail recursion, exception handling, automatic memory
management while fitting both compiler and virtual machine into about 6k lines of C++
code.

Repository is available on https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/quirrel and your PR's and feedback are welcome!
